In 2021, a predecessor of ALESCOPE ran a performance analysis workshop series. A summary, analysis and lessons-learned were published in this report:
 - [A novel performance analysis workshop series concept, developed at Durham University under the umbrella of the ExCALIBUR programme](https://zenodo.org/record/5155503)
 
 A new and improved version of this workshop is currently in development and will very likely run in 2023.
