In 2021, a predecessor of ALESCOPE ran Performance Analysis workshop series. A summary, analysis and lessons-learned were published in this report:
 - [A novel performance analysis workshop series concept, developed at Durham University under the umbrella of the ExCALIBUR programme][https://zenodo.org/record/5155503 "Title"]
 
 A new and improved version of this workshop is currently in development and will very likely run in 2023.
